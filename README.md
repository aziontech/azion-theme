![Sass Cover Azion Theme](./doc/cover-image.png)

The Azion Theme repository is focused on sharing our style kit across interfaces and should be used in all company projects,
including Azion Console Kit, Azion Site, Landing Pages, and all user interactions with Azion.


## Easy to install

To install the azion-theme project, you need to follow the command.
Choice one of your preference: npm or yarn;

``` bash
npm install azion-theme --save
# or
yarn add azion-theme
```

Alternatively, you can configure the package.json file by adding the dependency:

``` json
{
  "dependencies": {
      "azion-theme": "Ë†1.4.0"
  }
}
```

After updating the package.json file, run npm install in the root of your project to install the Azion Theme.


### Easy to connect with Front-End Project

To integrate the Azion Theme into your front-end project,
you need to import the theme files in your project's entry point file (App.vue, main.js, index.js, etc.):

``` javascript
import 'azion-theme/dark';
import 'azion-theme/light';
```

Make sure to include these imports at the top of your entry point file
to ensure the styles are applied correctly throughout your application.


## How to locally development

To work locally, you should clone both the `azion-theme`
repository and the another repository where theme will be used.

### Example:
In this example, we will use the [azion-webkit](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-webkit) repository:

1. Clone the `azion-webkit` and `azion-theme` repositories;
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aziontech/azion-webkit.git
    git clone https://github.com/aziontech/azion-theme.git
  ```

2. Installing dependecies and create the link point;
  ```bash
    cd ./azion-theme && npm i && npm link
  ```

3. Linking the `azion-theme` to the `azion-webkit` project;
  ```bash
    cd ../azion-webkit && npm i && npm link azion-theme
  ```

Any modifications made to `azion-theme` will be reflected on this development server with hot reload.
